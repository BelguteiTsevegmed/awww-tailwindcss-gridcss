        <h2>Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944)</h2>
        <p>
          Russian-born artist, Wassily Kandinsky, is widely regarded as one of
          the pioneers of abstract art. He believed that art should visually
          represent the artist's inner spiritual and emotional experiences.
          Kandinsky's early works were influenced by Russian
          <em>folk art</em> and <em>Impressionism</em>. However, his encounter
          with the artworks of the Fauvists and the vibrant colours of Matisse
          sparked his shift towards <strong>abstraction</strong>.

                    Squares with Concentric Circles (Farbstudie - Quadrate und
                    konzentrische Ringe), perhaps, Kandinsky's most recognizable
                    work, is not actually a full-fledged picture. This drawing
                    is a small study on how different colour combinations are
                    perceived that the painter used in his creative process as a
                    support material. For Kandinsky, colour meant more than just
                    a visual component of a picture. Colour is its soul. In his
                    books, he described his own perspective on how colours
                    interacted with each other and with the spectator in detail
                    and very poetically. Moreover, Kandinsky was a synaesthete,
                    i.e. he could ‘hear colours’ and ‘see sounds.’ So, this is
                    probably righteous that after a century, it is not one of
                    his compositions – which he himself considered as his main
                    achievements – but this small drawing that has become one of
                    Kandinsky’s most popular works.

                    Kandinsky’s Composition VII is justly considered to be the
                    apex of his artwork before the First Word War. More than 30
                    sketches made in watercolors and oil paints precede this
                    painting, and they can serve as “documentary” proof of this
                    work creation. Surprisingly that after the painter had
                    finished his long preliminary work, the composition itself
                    was created for 4 days only. This can be proved by
                    photographs taken between the 25th and the 28th of November
                    1913. The main theme, which is an oval form intersected by
                    an irregular rectangle, is perceived like the center
                    surrounded by the vortex of colors and forms. By means of
                    records and some works examination art historians defined
                    that the Composition VII is a combination of several themes
                    namely Resurrection, the Judgment Day, the Flood and the
                    Garden of Eden. Such combination is expressed as a symbiosis
                    of pure painting.

                    In 1925, Kandinsky taught the basic design class for
                    beginners and the course on advanced theory at the Bauhaus;
                    he also conducted painting classes and a workshop in which
                    he augmented his colour theory with new elements of form
                    psychology. The development of his works on forms study,
                    particularly on points and line forms, led to the
                    publication of his second theoretical book (Point and Line
                    to Plane) in 1926. Geometrical elements took on increasing
                    importance in both his teaching and painting - particularly
                    the circle, half-circle, the angle, straight lines and
                    curves. This period was intensely productive. This freedom
                    is characterised in his works by the treatment of planes
                    rich in colours and gradations - as in Yellow-Red-Blue
                    (1925), where Kandinsky illustrates his distance from the
                    constructivism and suprematism movements influential at the
                    time.
